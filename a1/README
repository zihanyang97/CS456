I did this assignment using c++11 standard, under student environment.

to run the test:
	1. open 2 termials, one for server, one for client
	2. unzip the zip file
	3. insert command "make" to compile server & client
	4. run ./server.sh <req_code> to open server on one terminal, and you can see the n_port after run the command
	5. run ./client.sh <server address> <n_port> <req_code> <msg> to open client on another terminal
	req_code should be the same number on both server and client
	server address is the address of server
	n_port is the port # server create randomly
	msg is the messasge you client wants to send to server
